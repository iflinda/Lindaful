**Lindaful** is a portfolio website that I created as a place to showcase the various projects that I've been working on during my journey as a Full-stack Web Developer. 

I initially created low-fidelity wireframes for the website with traditional media before creating a high-fidelity prototype in Figma. I selected tranquil and relaxing colors while focusing on how to showcase my uniqueness. I wanted the website to embody my creative flair and personality.

I hope you enjoy visiting the website, and have a **Lindaful** Day!
